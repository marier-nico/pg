# Description

<!---
Describe the content of your PR.
Here, you should explain what the changes do
and why they are being added.

The title and description of your PR should respect the git commit
message style guide (see [contributing.md](https://github.com/marier-nico/pygpg/blob/main/.github/contributing.md)),
because they will be used to create a commit.

Release: #<!-- replace this comment with [patch|minor|major|none] -->

<!---
You can omit to specify the release if a new version of pygpg should
not be published to PyPi. If you do, the different values have the
following meaning :

1. major for incompatible API changes,
2. minor for added functionality (backwards compatible), and
3. patch for backwards compatible bug fixes.
